Harald Barsnes is a group leader at both the Computational Biology Unit at the Department of Informatics and at the 
Proteomics Unit at the Department of Biomedicine, both at the University of Bergen, Norway. The main focus of his 
group is the development of user-friendly open-source bioinformatics tools that enable and empower researchers to 
analyse and share their own data. His research has resulted in numerous publications and a long list of freely available 
proteomics software, e.g., PeptideShaker, SearchGUI and PRIDE Converter. Barsnes has also been a guest editor in PROTEOMICS 
and has co-authored a Wiley text book called 'Computational and Statistical Methods for Protein Quantification by 
Mass Spectrometry'. In 2015 he received the Meltzer Award for Excellent Young Researchers at the University of Bergen, 
and in 2016 he was awarded a prestigious recruitment fellowship from the Bergen Research Foundation.

Lieven Clement is an Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics at Ghent University. 
He is an expert in developing statistical methods and open source tools for differential omics data analysis. 
His research efforts resulted in numerous publications on novel methods and tools for, and applied research 
in omics data analysis. His lab is built around three strategic research pillars each connected to an omics domain: 
metagenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics and he also has a strong interest in leveraging his expertise to translational 
research. He also serves as a member of the core team that established a new Master of Science in Bioinformatics at 
Ghent University, as a board member of the Belgian Proteomics Association, as an expert in genomics projects of the 
Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center (KCE), and as an Associate Editor for the journal Biometrics (2011-2017).
